ZTech - altering research difficulty of Factorio

By default vast majority of Factorio research projects take equal amount of all the science packs. I for one don't think this is quite as good as it could be. This mod makes it so that the more different science packs are used in research the more of the lower-level packs you'll need. 

For example rocket defense would require 8 red, 4 green, 2 blue and 1 alien science packs.
Things that require 3 types of packs would require 4 red, 2 green and 1 blue packs.
Things with 2 packs would have their red pack usage doubled.
Things that only take red packs won't have their recipes changed.


Currently the recipes that use anything but the usual science packs are wonky (other ingredients than science packs, same type of science pack in more than one slot, skipping lower-level packs in recipes, ... )
